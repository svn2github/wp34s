This code is the source for the internal product routine.

The only change of note is the call to the user's routine is done as XEQ 00
instead of XEQUSR.

This routine just loops around a standard DSE loop executing the function and 
multiplying the result into the product.

Registers used:
	00	DSE loop counter (user supplied)
	01	Product
	03	Saved initial loop counter (goes into L on exit)

Labels used:
	B	Main entry point (never targetted)
	00	User's function to sum
