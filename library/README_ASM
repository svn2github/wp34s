This directory contains some sample program files written in a format compatible
with the WP-34s assembler/disassembler tool.

To assemble the source files into flash images that can be loaded as per the WP-34s
calculator manual, run the following (note that the path to the assembler script may
be different in your particular environment):

$ ../trunk/tools/wp34s_asm.pl SOME_FILE.wp34s -o wp34s-1.dat

To assemble several programs into a single flash image that can be loaded as per the manual,
run the following:

$ ../tools/wp34s_asm.pl derivative.wp34s integrate.wp34s product.wp34s quadratic.wp34s solver.wp34s sum.wp34s -o wp34s-1.dat

Th remaining programs can be built into a second flash image as well:

$ ../tools/wp34s_asm.pl 8queens.wp34s code_breaker.wp34s fibonacci.wp34s primesieve.wp34s -o wp34s-2.dat

A look at the sizes of all the programs in this example set will indicated that there are a
few too many steps in the cummulative set to fit into a single flash page (flash image is limited
to 506 program words). Therefore to fit them all into the calculator at one time, they need to be
written to 2 flash pages ('wp34s-1.dat', and 'wp34s-2.dat' are used in the above examples).

The program entry labels have been modified from the original '*.txt' files so that each is
unique. Since they now are alpha lables, they can be viewed using the 'CAT' function on the
calculator.

These files can serve as a set of examples in how to write compatible assembly
source files for the WP-34s calculator's assembler.

Note: A working Perl installation is required to run this assembler/disassembler.
Consult the assembler manual for more details or go to common locations such as
http://strawberryperl.com/ and/or http://www.activestate.com/activeperl for more
information about Perl downloads.

WARNING: There has been no examination of whether numeric labels collide in concatenated
program combinations within a single flash image. See page 12 of the calculator reference manual
for details of how the labels are searched by the calculator. A future version of the assembler
may put checks in to ensure that potential label collisions are detected at assembly-time. These
'*.wp34s' programs are provided as examples of syntax, format, and form WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY. It
is up to the user to verify correctness.
