As a rule a vector occupies a triple of stack registers usually X, Y & Z or
T, A & B.  Scalars occupy one stack level.  Operations save their first
argument to last X (L for scalars and L, I & J for vectors).


The function provided here are:

X.Y
	Vector dot product.  Input vectors in X,Y,Z and T,A,B.
	Output scalar in X.  Second vector unchanged in Y,Z,T and
	the first vector in L,I,J.

	result = X*T + Y*A + Z*B


V+
	Vector addition.  Input vectors in X,Y,Z and T,A,B.
	Output vector in X,Y,Z.  Second vector unchanged in T,A,B.
	The first vector is saved in L,I,J.


V-
	Vector subtraction.  Behaviour as for V+.


V<->
	Vector swap.  Swaps X,Y,Z with T,A,B.


Vun
	Unit vector from vector.  Replaces X,Y,Z with the equivalent
	unit vector.  Saves the recprocal of the vectors length in L.
	To undo this operation:
		RCL L
		1/x
		V*S


V*S
	Vector multipled by scalar.  Vector in Y,Z,T and scalar in X.
	Saves the scalar in L.


VAB
	Vector absolute value (modulus).  Vector in Y,Z,T.  Returns
	the length in X (dropping the vector).  The original vector
	is saved in L,I,J.


V+-
	Vector change sign.  Replaces the vector in X,Y,Z with its
	negative.  The original vector is saved in L,I,J.


VLX
	Vector equivalent of LastX.  Pushes a vector stored in L,I,J onto
	the stack.


TO DO:
	Cross product.
