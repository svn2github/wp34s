This code is the source for the internal sigma/sum routine.

The only change of note is the call to the user's routine is done as GSB 00
instead of XEQUSR.

This routine just loops around a standard DSE loop executing the function and 
Kahan summing it into the accumulator (for added accuracy when summing many small
values).

Registers used:
	00	DSE loop counter (user supplied)
	01	Summation
	02	Summation carry
	03	Saved initial loop counter (goes into L on exit)

Labels used:
	B	Main entry point (never targetted)
	00	User's function to sum
