Version 2.2

This is beta firmware for the WP34S calculator.  This is for HP's 20b
and 30b hardware.  Being beta software, there will be problems and
rough edges.  Please show a bit of tolerance and patience in this
regard.  The emulator will run under Windows (XP SP2 and later) or
using WINE on Linux and Macintosh computers. A ROM file for use on the
real hardware is provided, too.

You will need a special programming cable and the MySamba software
to reflash a 20b or 30b (see the folder FlashTool on our SourceForge 
pages where you found this file.)

Before asking questions or posting bug reports, please read the
included manual.  Not all of the many features of this powerful
device are entirely obvious but they are documented and they are
intended to be internally consistent.


Bug reports, suggestions and problems should be reported to:

	Paul Dale <ppzgs1@gmail.com>, 
    Walter Bonin <walter.bonin@web.de>,
and Marcus von Cube <marcus@mvcsys.de>

The programming cable is available for the costs of shipping from

    Gene Wright <genewright143@hotmail.com>

Keyboard overlays in professional quality are provided by

    Eric Rechlin <eric@hpcalc.org>

Known problems:

The emulator does not run under Windows 2000 and likely never will.

The PC keyboard to calculator keyboard mapping isn't entirely obvious.

The displayed revision numbers in the VERS screen may differ between the manual,
the flash image and the emulator.
