This is an alpha demo of the WP34S calculator firmware for HP's 20b
and 30b hardware.  Being alpha software, there will be problems and
rough edges.  Please show a bit of tolerance and patience in this
regard.  This demo will run under Windows (XP SP2 and later) or
using WINE on Linux and Macintosh computers. A ROM file for use on the
real hardware is provided, too.

Before asking questions or posting bug reports, please read the
included manual.  Not all of the many features of this powerful
device are entirely obvious but they are documented and they are
intended to be internally consistent.


Bug reports, suggestions and problems should be reported to:

	Paul Dale <ppzgs1@gmail.com>
and     Walter Bonin <walter.bonin@web.de>.



Known problems:


The emulator does not run under Windows 2000 and likely never will.

The PC keyboard to calculator keyboard mapping isn't entirely obvious.

We are working on the precision of some functions.

The displayed revision numbers in the VERS screen may differ between the manual,
the flash image and the emulator.
