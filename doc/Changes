This is a list of things to consider doing differently.

Merge the function tables.  Currently, there are tables for monadic,
dyadic, triadic, niladic and argument functions.  It would be better to
merge these into one or two tables (two: one for argument functions,
one for everything else).  The tables would contain information like
the number of arguments accepted, the number of values returned, weather
last X is set and if stack lift shold be anabled.  This would streamline
and simplify functions -- at a cost of a slightly more complex dispatch
mechanism.  It would also remove all the special cases.


Secondly, implement a small interpretive language for defining functions.
Keystroke programs are much smaller than the associated C code but they
are limited by both the small stack and the limited precision we permit.
Ideally a small simple language with a large suite of primatives operating
at full precision.
