To convert a 20b to 34s.


To clean off the keys:

1/ Use a battery Dremel rotary tool on its lowest speed setting
with a 400 grit sanding disc.  Carefully erase the writing.  This
will scratch the key noticably so erase all keys even those which
could have been reused and those with blanks on the front face.  We
want them all to look the same.  Don't sand too much away.  My mains
powered Dremel runs quite a bit faster on its slowest setting so I
avoided it.

2/ Run a felt polishing pad in a mains powered Dremel rotary tool
on the lowest or second lowest speed setting to polish out the
obvious scratches.  Use polishing compound sparingly.  Again be
careful and don't polish away too much.

The end result looks okay.  Check that you've still got all 37 keys.


The same procedure can be used on the faceplate to remove the left
side text.  It is much harder to do this well because the faceplate
is glossy.


Relabelling the keys:

Use on of the overlays provided in the "real" folder.


Installing the new firmware:

Get SAM-BA from Atmel and the special cable from HP. Follow the
