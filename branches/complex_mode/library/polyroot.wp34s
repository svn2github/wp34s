/* Program originally by Valentin Albillo for the HP-41 series.
 * Converted ftoor the 34S by Miguel Toro.
 *
 * Here is a version for the WP 34S of Albillo's original program for
 * the HP 41. I would like to thank Angel Martin for helping me with
 * lot of information, documentation and his own version for the 41z.
 * Porting the program was very straightforward. The only real difference
 * I found between commands was with the SIGN function that behaves
 * like it does in the 3Xs family rather than it does in the 41 and
 * 42 calculators, so I have to replace it in my code.
 * 
 * The program has been tested with version 2.2 rev. 1782. Just copy
 * it in a file and assemble it to try in the emulator and the calculator
 * 
 * Testing the examples from the article on the calculator, I obtained
 * the same results, with the following time:
 * 
 * Example 1) 5 seconds:
 *
 * (2+8i)z^6 + (3+0i)z^5 + (-1+2i)z^4 + (0+2i)z^3 +
 *				(-3-3i)z^2 + (1+2i)z + (-2+3i) = 0
 *
 * Example 2) 3,5 seconds:
 *
 * 5x^6 + 4x^5 + 3x^4 + 8x^3 + 8x^2 + 2x + 7 = 0
 *
 * Note: You can delete the STOP just before pr06. It is there just for testing.
