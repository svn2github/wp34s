New (and existing functions) and their sizes:

Jacobi elliptic functions SN, CN & DN			1780 bytes
	real and complex.

Bessel functions of first and second kinds		4470 bytes
	Jn & In real and complex (argument and order).
	Yn & Kn real and complex (argument and order).

Digamma function (PSI)					1384 bytes
	real and complex.
	needed for bessel functions of second kind of integer order.

Zeta							2012 bytes
	real and complex.

cube / cube root					576 bytes
	integer, real and complex.

x!!							288 bytes
	real and complex.

EASTER							384 bytes

Fused multiply/add					96 bytes
	integer and real.
	The real version can be replaced by complex multiply.
	x+y*z can be done via (y, x) * (z, -1) at a pinch.

AGM							528 bytes
	limit of arithmetic geometric mean.

PRIME?							576 bytes
	Conditional test for X being prime.
	Exact for x < 66049, Miller-Rabin with 40 iterations otherwise.
	P(claiming a composite is prime) = 2^-80 (approximately)

	This routine also includes overflow resistant code for
	(a * b) mod c and (a ^ b) mod c which could also be exposed
	if required.


None of these are counting the catalogue and function table overheads.
Two bytes for a catalogue entry (one for each catalogue it is in) and
12-20 bytes for a function table entry (but only one of these).
i.e. not terribly significant.


My preferences for these would be to include the first five and PRIME?
These are all moderately useful functions.


Futures:

Bessel functions for complex argument and order working or removed.  Removing
them will more than halve the space requirement.

Hankel functions (bessel functions of the third kind):

	H1(n,z) = Jn(z) + i Yn(z)
	H2(n,z) = Jn(z) - i Yn(z)
