New (and existing functions) and their sizes:

Jacobi elliptic functions SN, CN & DN			1780 bytes
	real and complex.

Bessel functions of first and second kinds		4470 bytes
	Jn & In real and complex (argument and order).
	Yn & Kn real and complex (argument and order).

Digamma function (PSI)					1384 bytes
	real and complex.
	needed for bessel functions of second kind of integer order.

x!!							288 bytes
	real and complex.

!n
	real subfactorial

EASTER							384 bytes

Fused multiply/add					96 bytes
	integer and real.
	The real version can be replaced by complex multiply.
	x+y*z can be done via (y, x) * (z, -1) at a pinch.

Integer factor						600ish bytes
	integer and real
	Given an integer in X, returns the smallest factor.
	For large X, this can take 30 seconds plus.


None of these are counting the catalogue and function table overheads.
Two bytes for a catalogue entry (one for each catalogue it is in) and
12-20 bytes for a function table entry (but only one of these).
i.e. not terribly significant.



Futures:

Bessel functions for complex argument and order working or removed.  Removing
them will more than halve the space requirement.

Hankel functions (bessel functions of the third kind):

	H1(n,z) = Jn(z) + i Yn(z)
	H2(n,z) = Jn(z) - i Yn(z)
