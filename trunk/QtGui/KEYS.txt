Mapping has been changed from the previous version to used mnemonics instead of a QWERTY based logic.
As long as we support multiple platforms, why not support multiple keyboard layouts as well.

Key mapping is from left to right and top to bottom:

A: a or A
B: b or B
C: c or C
D: d or D
->: right arrow
CPX: i, I, y, Y, z or Z (i.e. letters somehow associated with complex numbers)

STO: s or S
RCL: r or S
R\|/: Page Down
f: f or F
g: g or G
h: h or H

ENTER: Return or Enter
X<>Y: < or >
+/-: p, P, m or M (i.e. plus or minus)
EEX: e or E
<-: Backspace or left arrow

XEQ: x or X
7: 7
8: 8
9: 9
./.: /

^: Up arrow
4: 4
5: 5
6: 6
x: *

\/: Down arrow
1: 1
2: 2
3: 3

EXIT: Escape

R/S: Right Arrow, Ctrl-Return, Shift-Return, Alt-Return, Ctrl-Enter, Shift-Enter or Alt-Enter. Some of these shortcut may not work.
