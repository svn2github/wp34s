This distribution was compiled under Ubuntu 11.10 using Qt 4.7.4. It does not come with Qt dynamic libraries as they are
probably already installed on your system.
If the emulator does not start or starts but then quit unexpectedly, it can be because the Qt libraries are not available
or too old.

You can then either try to get more recent one or retrieve a Qt SDK (4.8.0 for instance) and recompile from the sources.

Another point: because building a full Linux application packaging is out of scope for this project, I've just included
the wp34s-logo.png in the distribution. You can install it yourself if you are fluent with KDE, Gnome or whatever
environment you are using. Unfortunately, I'm not.

P. Meheut.
