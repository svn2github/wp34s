The emulator stores non-volatile memory and flash regions in .dat files.
Non-volatile memory is in wp34s.dat, flash regions in wp34s-R.dat and wp34s-1.dat to wp34s-9.dat


These files are searched in different directories:

- first in the user's application data directory:
	- on Linux, $HOME/.config/WP-34s
	- on MacOSX, $HOME/Library/Preferences/WP-34s
	- on Windows, %APPDATA%\WP-34S 

- then on MacOSX only, in the package ressources directory:
<ExecutableDirectory>/../resources/memory

- finally, in the "memory" subdirectory of the executable directory

The .dat files near the excutable are read-only. Memory and flash regions are always written in the user's ones.
