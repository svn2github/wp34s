---------------------- USAGE ----------------------
To use the serial port, simply enter the preferences dialog and select one. If it does not appear in the list, you can simply enter its name

---------------------- RECOMPILING THE SERIAL LIBRARIES (Optional) ----------------------

The serial port communication is optional. To compile without it, simply type 'make qt_gui_no_serial' in the wp34s trunk directory

This module uses the open-source project qextserialport to provide serial-port
communication with real WP-34s units. 

I have compiled the librairies and added them to the WP-34s project so you should not have to recompile them but here are the instructions do to so.

See http://code.google.com/p/qextserialport/ for more information about this project.

It comes with precompiled libraries for Windows, Mac OSX & Linux. However, as these libraries where compiled
on specific platforms (Windows 7/MinGW, OSX Lion, Ubuntu 11.10/gcc-4.6), they may not work on your platform and are not suitable
because of a bug.


First, you'll have to make sure that the Mercurial, free source control management tool, is installed on your system.

Go to http://mercurial.selenic.com/ to download a version.


On Mac OSX & Linux, get the sources:

hg clone https://code.google.com/p/qextserialport

Then edit the src/src.pro qmake config file and make sure that the "CONFIG += staticlib" is uncommented.
run 'qmake' at the top level then 'make release'.

On Mac OSX, copy the src/build/libqextserialport.a into the QtGui/serial/lib/Darwin directory 
On Linux, copy the src/build/libqextserialport.a into the QtGui/serial/lib/Linux directory 


On Windows, you'll need a different set of sources as qextserialport does not goes well with recent versions
of Qt.

The project to use is:

http://code.google.com/r/dbzhang800-qextserialport/

and you must retrieve the sources with:

hg clone https://code.google.com/r/dbzhang800-qextserialport/

Then in the dbzhang800-qextserialport directory created by hg:

- copy config_example.pri to config.pri
- edit config.pri and uncomment the 'QEXTSERIALPORT_LIBRARY = yes' & 'QEXTSERIALPORT_STATIC = yes'
- run qmake
- run the appropriate make, usually the mingw32-make that comes with Qt as 'mingw32-make release'

The enter the 'lib' subdirectory and copy 'libqextserialport-1.2.a' into the QtGui/serial/windows32 directory.

IMPORTANT: 

If dbzhang800-qextserialport does not compile, edit src/qextserialport.pri and replace line 35, i.e:

    win32:!exists($$[QT_INSTALL_HEADERS]/QtCore/private/qwineventnotifier_p.h){

By

#    win32:!exists($$[QT_INSTALL_HEADERS]/QtCore/private/qwineventnotifier_p.h){
     win32:{
