This module uses the open-source project qextserialport to provide serial-port
communication with real WP-34s units.

See http://code.google.com/p/qextserialport/ for more information about this project.

It comes with precompiled libraries for Windows, Mac OSX & Linux. However, as these libraries where compiled
on specific platforms (Windows 7/MinGW, OSX Lion, Ubuntu 11.10/gcc-4.6), they may not work on your platform.

First, you'll have to make sure that the Mercurial, free source control management tool, is installed on your system.

Go to http://mercurial.selenic.com/ to download a version.


On Mac OSX & Linux, get the sources:

hg clone https://code.google.com/p/qextserialport

Then edit the src/src.pro qmake config file and make sure that the "CONFIG += staticlib" is uncommented.
run 'qmake' at the top level then make.

On Mac OSX, copy the src/build/libqextserialportd.a into the QtGui/serial/lib/Darwin directory 
and rename it to libqextserialport.a 

On Linux, copy the src/build/libqextserialport.a into the QtGui/serial/lib/Linux directory 


On Windows, you'll need a different set of sources as qextserialport does not goes well with recent versions
of Qt.

The project to use is:

http://code.google.com/r/dbzhang800-qextserialport/

and you must retrieve the sources with:

hg clone https://code.google.com/r/dbzhang800-qextserialport/

Then in the dbzhang800-qextserialport directory created by hg:

- copy config_example.pri to config.pri
- edit config.pri and uncomment the 'QEXTSERIALPORT_LIBRARY = yes' & 'QEXTSERIALPORT_STATIC = yes'
- run qmake
- run the appropriate make, usually the mingw32-make that comes with Qt

The enter the 'lib' subdirectory and copy 'libqextserialport-1.2d.a' into the QtGui/serial/windows32 directory.
Rename it to libqextserialport.a

To use the serial port, simply enter the preferences dialog and select one. If it does not appear in the list, you can simply enter its name
