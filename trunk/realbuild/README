calc.bin and calc_full.bin work on an unmodified 20b or 30b.

calc_xtal.bin and calc_xtal_full.bin need the quartz crystal modification.

calc_ir.bin and calc_ir_full.bin add printing which needs the IR diode
and the quartz crystal modification installed.

The "_full" variants contain precompiled library code and are recommended.
